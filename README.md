# 🌤️ SkyScout – Cross-Platform Weather App

SkyScout is a polished, cross-platform weather application built with **Expo** and **React Native**, designed to run smoothly on **iOS** and the **web** from a single codebase.

The app focuses on real-world UX details such as haptics, sound feedback, drag-and-drop interactions, and clean, mobile-first UI design inspired by native iOS weather apps.

- 📳 **Haptic feedback**
  - Light, medium, and warning haptics for different actions
- 🧼 **Clean UI**
  - Compact, list-based layout optimised for mobile screens
  - Glow effects and animations clipped correctly within bounds
- 🌍 **Cross-platform**
  - Runs on iOS Simulator, physical iPhone, and web browser

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```
## 2️⃣ Run on iOS (recommended)

Requires Xcode and iOS Simulator (macOS)

```
npx expo run:ios
```
This uses an Expo development build, which is required for native features such as:
	•	Audio
	•	Haptics
	•	Gesture handling

## 3️⃣ Run on Web
```
npm start
```
Then press w in the Expo CLI, or open:
```
http://localhost:8081
```
note: Some native effects (haptics, drag physics) are simplified on web.

## 🔊 Sound & Haptics
	•	Sound effects are enabled by default
	•	Users can toggle sound on/off via the switch in the app header
	•	iOS audio is configured to:
	•	Play in silent mode
	•	Mix with other audio
	•	Avoid dropped or missed sound playback

This behaviour was intentionally engineered to handle common iOS audio edge cases.

## 🧠 Design Decisions

	•	Single codebase for iOS and web
	•	Explicit audio serialisation to ensure reliable playback on iOS
	•	Clipped list containers to prevent glow/drag overflow
	•	Compact list layout to maximise visible content on small screens
	•	Clear separation of concerns between UI components and app logic

## 📌 Possible Future Improvements

	•	Persist favourites using AsyncStorage
	•	Add hourly / daily forecasts
	•	Dark / light theme toggle
	•	Offline caching
	•	App Store / TestFlight deployment

## 👋 About the Project 
SkyScout was built as a portfolio project to demonstrate practical skills in:

	•	Mobile UI/UX
	•	Cross-platform development
	•	Native device features
	•	Debugging real-world platform quirks (especially iOS audio)

It reflects how modern software engineers work today — iterating quickly, testing on real devices, and focusing on user experience details.
